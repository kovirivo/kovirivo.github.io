      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>This website was created to help potential Study Zone visitors and volunteers understand what Study Zone is. It is also designed to help advertise Study Zone. The website contains two infographics that try to be as accessible for as many people as possible. Certain aspects of Study Zone were highlighted based on its targeted demographic. Study Zone being free is not always known by many patrons. With these certain aspects quickly and highlighted, many are able to quickly understand what Study Zone is. The website was also created to recruit tutors. Many do not realize the benefits of helping out community members and how much they are needed. Overall, Study Zone needs to be seen by more people, as it is a valuable asset to the community.</p>
